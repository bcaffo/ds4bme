# Class notes from 3/26

#### Final Project
* rubric to be released
* data-level app
* statistical processing of information
* receive input from user
* output processed data
* needs to be data-oriented

#### Anouncements
* HW due Wednesday
* No quiz this week

#### Hand-drawn notes
* probability density functions
* probability larger than 5 is the area highlighted
* inconvenient to characterize the entire density
   * use properties instead
 * mean ==> expected value of random variable
  * property of the density
  * mu = mean
  * if the density is symmetric, the mean is in the middle
  * can be undefined or infinite
* variance
  * expected value of...
* alpha quantile
  * x_0.5 = median
* median
  * also defined (real?)
  * noninfinite, nonzero
* x = argmax f(x) = mode
* properties allow to describe the curve without giving the whole thing
* tilde (~) means independent
* E[X_bar} = mu
* E[X_i] = mu
* lots of ways to estimate mu, only one to extime X_bar
* histogram of average of 100 normals --> normal distribution, mean = 100, standard deviation = 1/100
* distibution of average will be identically normal
* standard error of the mean
  * standard error ++ stadnard deviation of a statistic
  * sigma/n^1/2

#### Lecture Notes
* Baye's Rule
* github.com/bcaffo/Caffo-Coursera/blob/master/lecture5.pdf
* change probability map due to observations
* Bivariate density
  * density with 2 variables
  * integral over both variables is 1
  
#### Handwritten notes
* graph of x and y in 3D cartesian
* satisty both conditions --> valid joint density

#### Lecture Notes
* umm

#### Handwritten Notes
* divide by right divisor to make subsection area equal to one

#### Lecture Notes
* Baye's rule
  * what's "t"?
  * to convert f(x|y) to f(y|x), only need f(x|y) and f(y)
  
#### Bootstrapping
* adventures of barren muchausen
* handwritten notes
* using data to resample selection
* resample medians from data, then...
* only works for large data sets that are a resonable approximation of the population
