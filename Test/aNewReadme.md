## What I have done:

1. Fork the course repository
2. Create a directory called `Test`
3. Add a markdown file to `Test` directory called `aNewRreadme.md`
4. Issue a pull request for the course repository
5. Create a new github repository called `ds4bmeTest` and a readme file
6. Clone the `ds4bmeTest`, modified the readme file and push the changes back up to my repo
7. Create a simple webpage; commit it to my repo and serve the webpage using github pages
8. Create a branch for `ds4bmeTest` called `development` and add a file called `testing.md`
