# Assignment 1

1. This is the markdown file I created for assignment one.

2. I forked the course repository, essentially copying it to my own github account.

I then cloned it to my local machine in order to create the new `Test` directory and `readme.md` file all in the terminal.

After making some changes in this markdown file, I added, committed and pushed the changes to github.
